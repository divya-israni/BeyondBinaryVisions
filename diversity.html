              <h2> What is Diversity and Inclusion? </h2>
              <p> Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) celebrates diverse experiences and perspectives, encompassing visible and unseen differences. Inclusion creates an environment where everyone feels valued. Championing D&I leads to creativity, better decision-making, and effective problem-solving. Sustained commitment and awareness of biases are crucial. Ultimately, D&I fosters fair, respectful, and productive spaces.</p>
